This mod has been completely inert for, like, years because Hopoo implemented an official Sacrifice artifact. Why are you here?

# ror2-sacrifice
A heavily customization-friendly mod that mimics Risk of Rain 1's Sacrifice artifact

# Customization
Customize all the variables in `BepInEx/config/com.anticode.Sacrifice.cfg`. Anything from what objects are banned, to spawn chances, to the effect of luck on drop chances. It's all there.

# What's New?
 - All interactables are now bannable
 - Drop chances can now be refined to decimal points
 - Neutral entities can no longer drop items
 - Player scaling rates can now be changed
 - Reverse scaling can now be enabled
 - Universal interactable spawn multiplier
 - Universal interactable cost multiplier
 - Item category drop weights can now be changed per enemy type killed (elite, boss, normal)
 - Fixed a bug where Engineer turrets would not correctly be replaced for network users.

# Todo:
 - sync with separate configuration library.
 - move Sacrifice behavior to an artifact.
