# ror2-sacrifice
A heavily customization-friendly mod that mimics Risk of Rain 1's Sacrifice artifact

# Customization
Customize all the variables in `BepInEx/config/com.anticode.Sacrifice.cfg`. Anything from what objects are banned, to spawn chances, to the effect of luck on drop chances. It's all there.

# Todo:
 - add option to change drop chances.
